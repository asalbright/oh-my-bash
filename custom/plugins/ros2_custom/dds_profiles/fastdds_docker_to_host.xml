<!-- Create a profile that explicitly turns off DDS shared memory comm.
     Shared memory comm does not work in dockers unless /dev/shm is mapped
     into the docker, and even then it is often problematic due to 
     ownership permissions differing between the host and the docker users.
     Turning off shared mem comm means that FastDDS will revert to 
     network-style comm instead. This is generally safe, though it is not as
     performant. -->
